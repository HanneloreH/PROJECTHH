Establishing a diagnostic pipeline for cgMLST analysis of outbreak samples

INTRODUCTION
Core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) is an elaborated method for characterizing isolates of microbial species on a DNA level using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). The high resolution typing of isolates has proven to be very useful for outbreak analysis. This project aims to automate the labour intensive analysis by generating pipelines perform:
-	Generation of a cgMLST scheme based on NCBI reference sequences available for the chose organism
-	Performing cgMLST analysis on raw sequencing data (fastq) of suspected outbreak samples.
This project will be executed as part of an internship "banaba bio-informatics" from October 2019 until August 2020.
