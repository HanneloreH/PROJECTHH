#################### TOOLS TO TEST ##################

Quality filtering
- Fastqc
- Metafastqc
- Multiqc

(OPTIONAL: Making smaller files (remove duplicates)
- Dedupe
- Picard
- Samtools)

Trimming
- Trimmomatic
	* might be a problem to use in nextflow because of dependancies(?)
- Bbduk

Looking at taxonomy
- Kraken
- Krona

De novo assembly
Review a lot of assemblers: https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-019-0626-5 
- Megahit
	* chose megahit because almost as good sensitivity as spades but faster
- Spades
- Velvet


Scaffolding (optional)
	= Link together a non-contiguous series of genomic sequences into a scaffold, consisting 	of sequences separated by gaps of known length. The sequences that are linked are typically 		contiguous sequences corresponding to read overlaps.
- contiguater

QC assembly
- Quast
	
cgMLST
- ChewBBACA
	* Preferred because also gives possibility to create schedules
- BigSdb
- Genome profiler
- MataList
(commercial software: Ridom SeqSphere, Bionumerics)

Visualisation
- R



################### PARAMETERS TO TEST ##################

- Analysis time
- size of generated files
- number of generated files
- structure of generated files
- critically look at differences in generated output
