GENERAL INFORMATION about the project before starting the actual generation of the pipe

Remark: a lot of this was adjusted/improved during the generation process


###################### INPUT #######################

Necessary input:
- path to fastq(s)
- SE or PE reads
- cgMLST scheme
- OR make scheme:
	-refseq number genome (GCF)
	- species name

- number of threads
- path for output

Optional input:
- parameters of trimming
- parameteres of assembly
- path to assembled genomes (to compare to in analysis)

Additional input: (can be calculated/retrieved)
- species
- number of bp sequenced
- reference genome



###################### OUTPUT #######################

Folder: "pipeline output"
- QC	
	* quality parameters of the raw data
- Assembly
 	* quality parameters of the assembly
	* fasta file of the assembly
- cgMLST
	* Allele difference in table format
	* Minimimum Spanning Tree of given samples
	* Minimimum Spanning Tree of given samples compared to given assembled genomes
	* Maximum Liklehood Tree of given samples
	* Maximum Liklehood Tree of given samples compared to given assembled genomes	 
- Conclusion
	* small conclusion + disclaimer
		- quality raw data
		- quality assembly
		- cgMLST samples part of same outbreak or not
	


#################### DATA ##################

Initially only 1  species is chosen to test: KP: Klebsiella pneumoniae, 
but in a later stage other species will be tested.



#################### TOOLS TO TEST ##################

Quality filtering
- Fastqc
- Metafastqc
- Multiqc

(OPTIONAL: Making smaller files (remove duplicates)
- Dedupe
- Picard
- Samtools)

Trimming
- Trimmomatic
	* might be a problem to use in nextflow because of dependancies(?)
- Bbduk

Looking at taxonomy
- Kraken
- Krona

De novo assembly
Review a lot of assemblers: https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-019-0626-5 
- Megahit
	* chose megahit because almost as good sensitivity as spades but faster
- Spades
- Velvet


Scaffolding (optional)
	= Link together a non-contiguous series of genomic sequences into a scaffold, consisting 	of sequences separated by gaps of known length. The sequences that are linked are typically 		contiguous sequences corresponding to read overlaps.
- contiguater

QC assembly
- Quast
	
cgMLST
- ChewBBACA
	* Preferred because also gives possibility to create schedules
- BigSdb
- Genome profiler
- MataList
(commercial software: Ridom SeqSphere, Bionumerics)

Visualisation
- R



################### PARAMETERS TO TEST ##################

- Analysis time
- size of generated files
- number of generated files
- structure of generated files
- critically look at differences in generated output
